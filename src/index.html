        <h2 class="about__title">About me</h2>
        <p class="about__text">Hello world! My name is Silje, and I'm a Danish, 24 year old girl, in training to become a front-end developer. I have an eye for detail and love problemsolving. One of my (many) great qualities is my ability to focus on a project. 
            
        I'm currently on the main course in VET (Vocational education and training) in Web development at <a class="about__text--link" href="https://www.rts.dk/in-english">Roskilde Technical College (VET).</a></p>
       
        <p class="about__text"> I'm currently looking for an internship in front-end development lasting six weeks (paid by my school - not you!) in the period <span class="about__text--date">22. January 2024 to 8. March 2024. </span></p>

        <section class="personal">
            <h2 class="personal__title">Personal life</h2>
            <p class="personal__text">I have plenty of hobbies that I love to do when I'm not coding. I enjoy rug tufting slightly ugly rugs, painting slightly ugly pictures, and bookbinding ugly paperbacks to much prettier hardbacks. My dog Bucky is also very happy when I take him on long walks, so I try to do that a lot too. I also enjoy reading, and read about 120 books a year.</p>

        <h2 class="work__title">Work</h2>
        <p class="work__text"> I still have about a year left of school (as I finish October 2024), so as my header says I'm still in training. But for the past 8 months I've worked with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We are currently working on automatisation, webpack and SASS. Next up is learning React JS(in Nov/Dec). Examples of my work here. </p>
